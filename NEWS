ARTool 0.10.0
=============

New features:

* Support for Error() terms in model formulas (resulting models are run using aov())
* Checks for numeric variables passed into formulas that may cause incorrect results (if the user intended data to be treated as categorical)
* More detailed ANOVA tables
* New vignette describing contrast tests, particularly for interactions (vignette("art-contrasts"))

Bugfixes:

* Formulas now correctly support arbitrary expressions as terms (rather than just column names).

ARTool 0.9.4
============
